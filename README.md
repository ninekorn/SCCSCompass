Edit-2021-july-13-03:18pm: I don't expect any of my fucking projects that i make in unity working the moment i fucking upload them anyway, because every fucking time that i shelve them, some fucking lurkers of shit are breaking them. So much time wasted on trying to build a project and everytime that you are at a 50-100 variables mark and tons of hierarchy setup in the scene that it would be too much clutter in our fucking mental palaces to remember all of my shelved unity projects that way, and you've got a solid start to come back to those shelved projects later, and when you come back to them, and you've got to fucking restart all over for the pleasure of lurkers that stole your fucking shit with cookie keyboard clicks and mouse clicks and then made sure in team to try and developp and license your own things/scripts faster than you are developping them because youre not developping them anymore, you are restarting them over again because they are scrapped. Youre projects are now scrapped and you have to start over from bits and pieces that are still fucking working and 95% of it is not working. When i come back to my sharpdx/ab3d.dxengine projects shelved or not, if it doesnt work, i get rid of dlls and reupdate nuggets making sure the packages.config file isn't cockblocking me from doing so and then my projects work 99.9999999999999% of the time. fucking gamick.

using Unity3D 2017.4.39f1

/////////////////////////
2020-june-21st - i barely could/can program anything ever since the 23rd of May. And this stagnation was caused by events that were explained in a prior post hilariously explained in egyptian fb scriptures. I am tired of this nonsense and now, since i still didn't receive my part of selling my house here, it causes more stress added to this. More and more because enough is never enough for some people. I've been a gamer before. I am temporarily going back to my favorites BattleField 4 and maybe Counter-Strike Global offensive and 7DaysToDie in the mix there. I need a good gaming frustration reliever for a while maybe. we will see.
end of...

# SCCSCompass2D turned to a SCCSCompass3D which i decided to put on the shelves to work on the SCCSGimbal...

Poetic introduction to my recent lived life. 

Corse Language follows...

...before the 23rd of May happened that is, where i got ultimately totally cockblocked and buttfucked... (hilariously explained in egyptian fb scriptures)
context is me chilling out at home writing on my personal facebook:

ultimately totally cockblocked and buttfucked...temporarily... from writing more details on my projects, those i have on github, atomic torch forums, elite dangerous forums, from releasing sccsVD4ED (hence why, when i forced myself out of that forced clusterfuck, legally, i did an a capella blitz release of my program sccsVD4ED, that was then removed temporarily, because licenses were not explained accordingly, in it's dedicated github repository. Also ultimately totally cockblocked and buttfucked...temporarily... from releasing my mod 9sMODs at atomic torch as a modder, from making and editing videos of all of the station interiors, that i have completely rebuilt, by my own hands, with my upcoming Void Expanse 9sMODs, including lost completely hand made Karate Shotokan Gishinkan blender animation moves (not all of them, maybe only 0.01% of them) from start to end of the move in question, including my lost physics tank tracks that are part of ones of my first unfinished and fake garbage 2017 game (tank tranks mesh to be verified as the colliders are there but not the mesh of the tank tracks themselves), that i didn't share yet before this paragraph, because i didn't have the time, so that verbal 🗣💩 and writen diarrhea 📜💩 could continue, without the community knowing what i am all about. I am not worried at all. I am, one day, maybe going to fix it all, one coin at a time, i might get there, rich out of building bitcoin mining games, before i die, of old age, and then i'll sue them all, except all of my family and everyone i love, one at a time, after i lay, in my tomb. yes, im gonna dream about it, even when dead. 😇

Corse Language stops temporarily...

😤  🧐
My projects can be used for all Turret Defense games but i wanted this on my version of a worms (team17) bitcoin game "genre". All other shooting games don't know how to shoot bullets properly when it's supposed to be an AI behind it that does the job, and when it's an AI that does the job, it's normally not supposed to ever fail. i wanted very precise, worms, getting hit in the head or the anus. preferably the anus. and then the worms could yell at you for shooting them USING System.Speech.Synthesis and System.Speech (if we can use those dependencies in Unity3d 2017.4.39f1). 

When the worms are hit, they would yell at you insults while you planify your next turn, turns that are just like those turns in a worms (team17) bitcoin game genre. The AI worms getting hit would yell at you or not,depending on their mood and the number of time that they have died or been shot at in that gaming session. They would yell at you things things like "imma get you next round ninekorn/ or stop shooting me in the anus ninekorn etc". Every players in the game would have their names inside of the machine learning worms (team17) bitcoin game genre, in order for worms 🗣💩  (verbal diarrhea) to be changed corresponding to which player they are against with, and for the machine learning worms to use accordingly, depending on the players prior moves or next moves at their turn. It would be hilarius. hilarius was my goal and it will continue to be. one coin at a time, i might get there, rich out of building bitcoin mining games, before i die of old age. 

more explanations/ideas/development coming soon.

English: using Brollof's Simple linear Perceptron found here https://github.com/Brollof/SimplePerceptron , i have made a 3D Compass  machine learning system for the x/y/z axis. You just need to move the "northpole/bullseye" around in the unity3D EDITOR. it's not working for the GAME mode yet. but i am undecided as to if i should call it that or call it a "three-gimbal mecanism" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal and i need more time to think about it.

Français: J'utilise le Perceptron Brollof Simple et linéaire que vous pouvez trouver ici https://github.com/Brollof/SimplePerceptron  et j'ai construit un système de Boussole en 3D pour les axes x/y/z. vous avez juste besoin de déplacer le "PoleNord/bullseye" dans le Unity3D EDITOR. ça ne fonctionne pas présentement dans le Unity3D GAME mode. mais je ne suis pas sûr encore si je continue d'appeler ça une Boussole 3D ou si j'appelle ça un mécanisme de "trois-cardans" https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardan_(suspension) et j'ai besoin de plus de temps pour y penser.

current known issues: the dot product by itself to slow down high speed rotating gimbal needles is not enough to stabilize them IF they are rotating too fast. i will soon lerp this or use both dot product and lerp. 

//not available yet: other project using parts of this system:
English: A planet type "voxel minecraft" shooter game at the same time 🙂. i built this game. not available anywhere else. work in progress
Français: Un shooter de planètes type "voxel minecraft" 🙂. c'est moi qui a construit ce jeu. présentement non disponible ailleurs. en développement .

# SCCSCompass v1.0
using Brollof's Simple Perceptron found here https://github.com/Brollof/SimplePerceptron , i have made a compass. You can divide the circumference of the 2d Circle to half angles or quarter angles and so on.
