# SCCSCompass2D turned to a SCCSCompass3D which i decided to put on the shelves to work on the SCCSGimbal...
Corse Language follows...
...before the 23rd of May happened that is, where i got ultimately totally cockblocked and buttfucked... (hilariously explained in egyptian fb scriptures)
context is me chilling out at home writing on my personal facebook:

ultimately totally cockblocked and buttfucked...from writing more details on my projects, those i have on github, atomic torch forums, elite dangerous forums, from releasing sccsVD4ED, from releasing my mod 9sMODs at atomic torch as a modder, and all of the tons of other projects, that lie on my hardrives, that i didn't share yet, because i didn't have the time, so that verbal and writen diarrhea could continue, without the community knowing what i am all about. I am not worried at all. I'm, one day, maybe going to fix it all, one coin at a time, i might get there, rich out of building bitcoin mining games, before i die, of old age, and then i'll sue all of those fuckers out, one at a time, after i lay, in my tomb. yes, im gonna dream about it, even when dead 😇  🧐

Corse Language stops temporarily...

My projects can be used for all Turret Defense games but i wanted this on my version of a worms (team17) bitcoin game "genre". All other shooting games don't know how to shoot bullets properly when it's supposed to be an AI behind it that does the job, and when it's an AI
that does the job, it's not supposed to ever fail. i wanted very precise, worms, getting hit in the head or the anus. preferably the anus. and then the worms could yell at you for shooting them USING System.Speech.Synthesis and System.Speech (if we can use those dependencies in Unity3d 2017.4.39f1). 

When the worms are hit, they would yell at you insults while you planify your next turn, turns that are just like those turns in a worms (team17) bitcoin game "genre". The AI worms getting hit would yell at you or not,depending on their mood and the number of time that they have died or been shot at in that gaming session. They would yell at you things things like "imma get you next round ninekorn/ or stop shooting me in the anus ninekorn etc". Every players in the game would have their names inside of the machine learning worms (team17) bitcoin game "genre", in order for text to be changed corresponding to which player they are against with, and for the machine learning worms to use accordingly, depending on the players prior moves or next moves at their turn. It would be hilarius. hilarius was my goal and it will continue to be. one coin at a time, i might get there, rich out of building bitcoin mining games, before i die of old age. 

more explanations/ideas/development coming soon.

English: using Brollof's Simple linear Perceptron found here https://github.com/Brollof/SimplePerceptron , i have made a 3D Compass  machine learning system for the x/y/z axis. You just need to move the "northpole/bullseye" around in the unity3D EDITOR. it's not working for the GAME mode yet. but i am undecided as to if i should call it that or call it a "three-gimbal mecanism" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal and i need more time to think about it.

Français: J'utilise le Perceptron Brollof Simple et linéaire que vous pouvez trouver ici https://github.com/Brollof/SimplePerceptron  et j'ai construit un système de Boussole en 3D pour les axes x/y/z. vous avez juste besoin de déplacer le "PoleNord/bullseye" dans le Unity3D EDITOR. ça ne fonctionne pas présentement dans le Unity3D GAME mode. mais je ne suis pas sûr encore si je continue d'appeler ça une Boussole 3D ou si j'appelle ça un mécanisme de "trois-cardans" https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardan_(suspension) et j'ai besoin de plus de temps pour y penser.

current known issues: the dot product by itself to slow down high speed rotating gimbal needles is not enough to stabilize them IF they are rotating too fast. i will soon lerp this or use both dot product and lerp. 

//not available yet: other project using parts of this system:
English: A planet type "voxel minecraft" shooter game at the same time 🙂. i built this game. not available anywhere else. work in progress
Français: Un shooter de planètes type "voxel minecraft" 🙂. c'est moi qui a construit ce jeu. présentement non disponible ailleurs. en développement .

# SCCSCompass v1.0
using Brollof's Simple Perceptron found here https://github.com/Brollof/SimplePerceptron , i have made a compass. You can divide the circumference of the 2d Circle to half angles or quarter angles and so on.
